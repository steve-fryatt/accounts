Version 5.16
============

Menu Groupings
--------------

    Dotted lines have been added to the menus to split up the options into
sensible groups.  This does not affect the use of the software in any way.

Replace Bug Removed
-------------------

    The bug in the 'Replace all' option has been removed, so that replacing
starts from the selected line, when initiated from the 'Text Found' dialogue
box.

Screen Redraw Improved
----------------------

    The screen redraw has been optimised, so that only the smallest part of
the window possible is redrawn when an operation is carried out.  This makes
most operations faster.

Version 5.17
============

The Toolbar
-----------

    A toolbar has been added to the main Accounts window, which supersedes
the toolbox, although the toolbox has been left for backwards compatability.
The toolbar, when set, appears above the column headings of the main window,
and contains a number of icons to activate or access several features of the
software.  From left to right, these are:

ADD ENTRY

INSERT ABOVE SELECTION

INSERT BELOW SELECTION

MODIFY SELECTION

DELETE SELECTION

    These icons operate in the same manner as in the Toolbox.

CUT SELECTION

    This icon activates the cut feature, which is also found in the
Clip-board menu and on F8 or Ctrl-V.

COPY SELECTION

    This icon activates the copy feature, which is also found in the
Clip-board menu and on F7 or Ctrl-C.

CLEAR SELECTION

    This will clear the selection, in the same way as pressing Ctrl-Z.

THE FILING ICON

    Clicking on this icon opens the Save window.  Double-clicking on the
icon opens the Export CSV window.

FIND AND REPLACE

    This icon opens the Find and Replace window.

GOTO LINE

    This icon opens the Goto window.

GOTO SELECTION

    This icon controls a new feature of Accounts.  Click on it to go
directly to the selected line in the account.

NEW HEADER

    This icon opens the New Header window.

THE PRINTER ICON

    Click on this icon to open the Print Account window.  Double-click on it
to open the Printer Set Up window.


    The Toolbar can be turned on and off using a new 'Toolbar' option at the
bottom of the Main Menu, or by pressing Ctrl-F2.  A new preference, in the
Miscellaneous section, called 'Show Tool Bar', can be used to specify
whether the tool bar appears when Accounts is first loaded.

The Preferences Window
----------------------

    Two new icons have been added to this window: "Load" and "Defaults". 
"Load" will load the preferences that are saved to disc bakc into the window
for either changing or accepting; while "Defaults" will do the same for a
new file called "Defaults" that is also found in the !Accounts directory,
containing the default values for the setings.

Version 5.18
============

The Toolbar
-----------

    Some of the bugs affectiong the use of the toolbar have been removed.

The Home Key
------------

    A new option has been added to the program preferences, allowing the
function of the Home key to be set.  The three settings heve the following
meanings:

    'Home main window'  will return the main account window to the top of
        the account;

    'Home caret' returns the caret to the top left icon of the enter pane;
        and

    'Home both' does both these actions together.
    
Version 5.19
============

Desktop Boot Files
------------------

    Accounts now responds to the desktop boot file feature of Risc OS 3.1. 
This allows desktop boot files to be automaticaly created by the user from
the Task Manager menu.

Desktop Shutdown
----------------

    If your data is unsaved, Accounts will warn you prior to a desktop
shutdown, so that you can save your work.
